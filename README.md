# personalTrainerServer

```
In order to run the application you need to export an environment variable that tells Flask where to find the application instance:

export FLASK_APP=personalTrainerServer

If you are outside of the project directory make sure to provide the exact path to your application directory. Similiarly you can turn on “debug mode” with this environment variable:

export FLASK_DEBUG=true

pip install pytest

In order to install and run the application you need to issue the following commands:

pip install -e .
flask run

py.test
```
